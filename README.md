# Chess

Chess is a re-creation of the timeless strategy board game. This version
which only uses basic rules (no castling, pawn promotion, or "en passant") and was my
first project as a developer, uses only vanilla Javscript (no classes), HTML, and CSS.
The game is for two players, with work in progress to enable sockets, allowing for online
play with friends.
